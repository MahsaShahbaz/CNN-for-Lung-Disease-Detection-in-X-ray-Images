Lung Disease Detection in X-ray Images using CNNs

This project explores the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify X-ray images into three categories: COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal. It includes data preprocessing, augmentation, and model development using various CNN architectures. The models evaluated include a basic CNN, depthwise CNN, CNN with attention mechanisms, and DenseNet.
